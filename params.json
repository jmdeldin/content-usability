{"body":"# Content Usability Toolkit\r\n\r\nThis is a Google Chrome extension to evaluate content based relevance,\r\nreadability, legibility, and navigability. It is a portion of my master's\r\nproject and is under heavy development.\r\n\r\n## Progress Report\r\n\r\n### 2012-10-17\r\n\r\nOver the weekend and the last few days, I:\r\n\r\n* Figured out how to build a Chrome extension\r\n* Designed the interface\r\n* Implemented readability\r\n  * I'm going to circle back later and implement a better method for finding text nodes. Right now, we just need some heuristics to ignore menu text.\r\n* Developed the architecture for having each metric communicate\r\n* Researched OOP in JavaScript (conclusion: it's unpleasant)\r\n\r\nYou can view my [code activity](https://github.com/jmdeldin/content-usability/commits/master) too.\r\n\r\nHere's what the extension looks like in action:\r\n\r\n![Evaluation of Dr Seuss Entry on Simple Wikipedia](http://i.imgur.com/ea25d.png)\r\n\r\n![Evaluation of a Wolfram Article](http://i.imgur.com/mFezq.png)","name":"Content Usability Toolkit","google":"UA-4757671-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
